<p>Turn that frown upside down! Huge fan of top notch banter. I am a very optimistic person, and I love to bring and
    enjoy a good team vibe.
    I like helping people solving issues of all sorts, because a group that doesn&#39;t face problems will run into
    bigger ones along the road.</p>
<h5 id="a-funny-story">A funny story</h5>
<p>4 years ago I fell off of a ginny, a platform, and hung at 10 meters height in my climbing gear for 20 minutes until
    my colleagues came back from their coffee break. At first I was yelling for help, but afterwards I gave in and
    decided to just hang back and relax.</p>
<h6 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h6>
<p>Climbing gear will wreck your nuts after 20 minutes.</p>
